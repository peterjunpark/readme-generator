## Description
### What is this?
A command line application to speed up the README writing process so you can spend more time coding and less time documenting.
### What does it do?
The README Generator asks a series of questions to help you fill out content for commonly appearing README sections.
It generates a formatted markdown file which you can use as the basis for your next project's README.
## Installation
### Dependencies
Node.js and npm are required to install this application. This application's functionalities depend on [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) (npm).
### Steps
1. Clone this repository into your desired location on your local machine.
2. Navigate to your local copy of the README Generator in your command line `cd`.
3. Use `npm install` to install dependencies (Inquirer v. 8.2.4) required to run the application.
## Usage
### Getting Started
1. Navigate to your local copy of the README Generator via your command line `cd`.
2. Enter `node index.js` to start the application.
3. Complete the prompts. Leave a prompt blank to exclude that section from your README (your project's title and license cannot be excluded).
4. Your generated README.md file will be created locally in the **output** folder.
